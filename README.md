# UseLess API

UseLess API is a kind of serverless lambda type endpoint, with a code editor to create your route and customize the code at your endpoint.

The back-end was made with Node/Express

The Front end is made with React

# Useage

If you are familier with Express and the app.get function parameter, you can use UseLess in a very similar way.

You can use the function section of this route making API similar in the way you use an app.get function parameter.

So in your code you create you can utilize the response, and request parameters from an app.get 

A typical UseLess API function will be similar to the example below.

`response.send("hello world")`

This will sent the string 'hello world' to the endpoint chosen by the user.
